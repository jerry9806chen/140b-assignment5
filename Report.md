# Assignment 5: A Sessioned Landing Page Report.md

## Jerry Chen (A13310365)

Initially I used my assignment 4 files as a framework and meant to maintain the same structure I had been maintaining for a while, keeping all of my website-related files in a static_page folder, and having the web server defined by a ui folder. However, I decided for the sake of parallel structure, it would be more efficient to move out all of the static_page files into the main repository folder and renaming the ui folder to web and modifying the accompanying files to acknowledge the change. After that, I removed the newsletter sign up and metrics pages as their existence would result in a rather confusing setup, as well as the news and database_size tables from init_db.py. Once the cleanup was complete, I then modified init_db.py to track down the email and password of each user in the Users table and to track the number of visits each route receives, and who visits each route at what time. I would occasionally run into the occassional bug here and there. Most notably a remnant line of code in docker-compose.yml prevented the server from functioning properly due to attempting to access the renamed ui folder. Other than that, the bugs had minimal effect. I also restructured all the html files to display when users were logged in, as I also restructured the web_server.py file to track each route's visitors. Eventually, once I built the admin page, I was able to produce the proper table output onscreen, but needed to format it properly. Lo and behold, i decided to borrow the formatting of the docker deployment tutorial, and after making some edits, I was able to produce the website at 161.35.232.113.
